        Sherlock Holmes is a consulting detective, portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in the British mystery crime drama television series based on Sir 
        Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes detective stories. Holmes is assisted by his flatmate and friend, Dr John Watson (Martin Freeman), 
        who has returned from military service in Afghanistan with the Royal Army Medical Corps. Although Metropolitan Police Service Detective 
        Inspector Greg Lestrade (Rupert Graves) and others are suspicious of Holmes at first, over time, his exceptional intellect and bold powers 
        of observation persuade them of his value. In part through Watson's blog documenting their adventures, Holmes becomes a reluctant celebrity 
        with the press reporting on his cases and eccentric personal life.

    <h3>Cast and Characters</h3>
    <p>
        Moffat and Vertue became interested in casting Cumberbatch as the title character after watching his performance in the 2007 film Atonement. 
        The actor was cast after reading the script for the creative team. The part is modelled as a charismatic secondary psychopath or 
        "High functioning sociopath" as Sherlock self-describes, unlike Doyle's rendering as a primary psychopath, thereby allowing more opportunity or 
        ambiguity for traits of empathy. "Cumberbatch", says The Guardian, "has a reputation for playing odd, brilliant men very well, and his Holmes is cold,
        techie, slightly Aspergerish".
